# Infrastructure

This document describes the infrastructure backing the EDPN project and from where each is accessible.

## Servers

Hardware available to the project, as well as in use, is outlined in the document [hardware-overview.md](https://github.com/ed-pilots-network/operations/blob/main/docs/hardware-overview.md) within this repository, along with the individual contacts responsible for these.

## Domains and DNS

Domains owned by or available to the project currently include:
- `edpn.io` - owned by [@pveeckhout](https://github.com/pveeckhout)
- `edpn.dev` - owned by [@AustinGoodrich/CascadianX](https://github.com/AustinGoodrich)

DNS for `edpn.io` is currently handled by Cloudflare under an EDPN account, which is currently accessible by [@madmax-codewarrior-0](https://github.com/madmax-codewarrior-0), [@pveeckhout](https://github.com/pveeckhout), and [@TheGuyDanish](https://github.com/TheGuyDanish)

DNS for `edpn.dev` is currently also handled by Cloudflare, however this is under [@AustinGoodrich/CascadianX](https://github.com/AustinGoodrich)'s personal account, not the shared EDPN account.
